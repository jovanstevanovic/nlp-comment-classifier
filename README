# SQL Comment Classifier

This project involves the development of a model that classifies SQL code comments into distinct categories, including
ToDo, Code, Functional, General, and more.

The project introduces a multifaceted classification system, ensuring that each comment type receives appropriate
categorization. Comments were categorized as ToDo for future tasks, Code for explanatory notes, Functional for
descriptions of code functionality, General for non-specific commentary, and additional categories to encompass various
contexts.
